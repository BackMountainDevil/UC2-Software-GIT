## Making **open-science** great again!
For a general introduction on UC2 please check our [CAD-repository](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT). Our basic belief centers around simple and clean modularity which - combined with creativity and curiosity - can lead to unthought achievements.

# Getting Started
Like with our toolbox we tried to keep our interfaces modular as well. Hence, hardware (like Motors, LED, ...) can be adressed using
*   Arduino (and alike) via I2C (Hardwired)
*   ESP32 (and alike) via MQTT (WiFI)

and could even be a mixture of both.Further, to control this components we provide two different graphical user interfaces (GUI):
*   Raspberry Pi (RasPi)
*   Android App

All useful links will be provided after the general shape of the repository is shortly displayed.

## Structure of Repository

	* 	coming
		*	soon


# Getting Started using the Raspberry Pi GUI

Find a detailed description [here](./GUI/RASPBERRY_PI/README.md)


# Getting Started using the Android APP

We have prepared a very basic control app for **TheBox** to have basic control over the hardware modules. The information can be found [here](./GUI/Android/UC2-TheBox).

# Setting up the Micro-Controller
Depending on the micro-controller that will be connected the code that is needed for flashing can be found in different folders.
* [The ESP32 + MQTT PATH](./HARDWARE_CONTROL/ESP32/README.md)
* [The ARDUINO + I2C PATH](./HARDWARE_CONTROL/ARDUINO/README.md)


# Get Involved!
This project is open so that anyone can get involved. You don't even have to learn CAD designing or programming. Find ways you can contribute in  [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/UC2-GIT/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Our software-oriented UC2-SOFTWARE-GIT provides you with all the different programs that you need to automate your blocks. Run our GUI on RasPi or Android-Phone and setup your Arduino or ESP32. We want to generalize our Software to even integrate more with community standards and have an overall compatibility with different Operating Systems.

Get **INVOLVED** by help us to:
*   switch to a new browser-based GUI
*   improve our MQTT based connection routines and trying to improve the necessary hardware-flashes
*   add totally unknown functions
*   make our Software as modular as possible
